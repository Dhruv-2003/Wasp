## What we do ?
We have created an Automated Asset Investment Strategy Platform powered by Chainlink , Uniswap V3 and Superfluid . There are 3 strategies majorly on our platform :-

Concentrated liquidity Manager - Our platform streamlines everything from investing an asset to changing the price range to provide 5 X Profit than an AMM to withdrawing the profit and sending it to you, in just one simple click using ChainLink .

Dollar Cost average - Dollar Cost averaging is an investement strategy where the user buys an asset at certain time intervals to reduce risks , the assets is bought at different prices in small amounts to average the out the price. Our Platform streamlines the process with just one click, putting your investing portfolio on auto pilot with Chainlink .

Range Orders - Range Orders also Called as Take Profit Order , where user supplies a low value asset at current price , Swap it for high value asset with assumption of increase in price , A Range Order is opened on Uniswap V3 Pool at the higher price range and automation closes the trade and claims the profit along with the liquidity fees for the user.

- Makes the onboarding for users really easy, just select any strategy and start investing.
- Provides a dashboard for user to track their investment.
- Implements all the logic that strategies require, with smart contracts.
- Automates every hassle for the user that otherwise he/she had to do when investing.
